# Aspect Overlay (Raid Lobby)

## Overview
- When you open a Raid Lobby, Wynnventory adds a panel to the right of the vanilla UI.
- The panel lists the available reward pools and shows their Mythic Aspects as clickable item icons.

## Details
- Aspect icons use Wynntils’ Guide Aspect items, matching the in-game aspect names.
- Each row displays the pool’s short name and its mythic aspects for quick reference.
- Clicking aspect icons behaves like regular item buttons (hover tooltips, etc.).

## When it appears
- On raid lobby screen initialization the overlay is injected and positioned next to the lobby UI.

## Why it helps
- Lets you quickly compare raid pools by their mythic aspects without leaving the lobby or opening other menus.
