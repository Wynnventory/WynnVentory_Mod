# Aspect Tooltips (Party Finder)

## Overview
- Adds a secondary tooltip panel when hovering raid reward pool entries in the Party Finder.
- Shows raid Mythic Aspects and useful lines next to the vanilla tooltip.

## When it triggers
- Only on the Party Finder screen, identified by its title.
- The feature uses Wynntils’ original item name to detect the corresponding raid reward pool.

## Rendering
- The extra tooltip panel is drawn adjacent to the vanilla tooltip.
- If there are no aspects to show, no extra panel is drawn.

## Notes
- This feature is tooltip-only on Party Finder. To see a full overview and quick-compare of pools, use the Aspect Overlay feature in the Raid Lobby.
